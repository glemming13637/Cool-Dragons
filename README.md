# Cool Dragons

Cool Dragons is a text-based RPG adevnture game written in Python 3.

You must have Python 3 installed to run the game.

If you've that installed, follow the steps below:
1. Click on the green "Clone or download" button, and click on "Download ZIP".
2. Once the zip folder has downloaded, extract the files to wherever you like.
3. There are many ways to run a Python script: using the command line, IDLE, or just 
   double clicking on the file, in a file explorer.
   
   You can run the game by running the command `python main.py` from the command line, 
   in the correct directory. However, the command `python3 main.py` or `py -3 main.py` 
   may work better on some computers. 
   
   If you set the Python 3 interpreter as the  default program for opening `.py` files, you 
   can just double-click on `main.py`, in a file exploer, to play the game.
   
   I believe every Windows and Mac installation includes IDLE, so only Linux users cannot use this option.
   If you have IDLE installed, right click on the file, in a file explorer, and click
   "Edit in IDLE". If that option isn't there when you right-click, you can open IDLE, hit Ctrl-O, and 
   open the file that way. From there, pressing F5 will run the game.

A quick Google search will give you more detailed instructions, if you include your operating system details in the 
search.
